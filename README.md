# exec-commands âˆ’ scan markdown files and execute `console` blocks

**exec-commands** is a utility to update command-line-tool examples embedded in markdown files. It scans `.md`-suffixed files in a directory, extracts all code blocks with a `console` attribute, executes each `$`-prefixed line in a shell, and embeds the result right below the line.

**Note: Please use exec-commands inside a sandbox. exec-command itself doesn't have any mechanism to protect the host environment from malicious commands embedded in markdown files.**

## Options

```console
$ exec-commands --help

## Configuration file format

It takes configuration in the yaml format. Below is an example and description of the fields.

```yaml
# `inputs` is an array of input files.
inputs:
  - README.md
  - doc/**/*.md  	# wildcard allowed; `**` matches directories with zero or more depths.

# `pwd` specifies the directory to run commands
pwd: "test"

# `path` is additional directories to search commands; it expands environment variables.
path: "target/debug:$HOME/.cargo/bin"

# `alt` is a list of command substitutions. when it finds `raw`, it executes `alt` instead.
alt:
  - raw: "EDITOR=vim nd --inplace --patch-back=vipe quick.txt"
    alt: "nd --inplace --patch patch.txt quick.txt"

# it executes a sequence of commands before and after every block and file.
hooks:
  pre_block:
    - "git clean -f -d"
    - "git checkout HEAD ."
  post_block:
    - ":"
  pre_file:
    - ":"
  post_file:
    - "git clean -f -d"
    - "git checkout HEAD ."
```
